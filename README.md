Get familiar with the concepts of Reinforcement Learning,by developing simple real time applications,this is a beginner-friendly web page which first deals with the nitty-gritty details about Reinforcement Learning,it's Applications,UseCases
and a little bit of Mathematics behind the scenes,and at the end one can browse through 3 different kinds of projects which are really intresting and are beginner-friendly,why wait,get your hands dirty with Reinforcement LearningðŸ¤–
This website comprises of 2components,one is the Theory Part and the other is the Projects Part,a begginer in Reinforcement Learning can get a great hands on experience by browsing
content and practicing the projects,avaliable on this website,here is the Theory and the Projects overview of the Website
